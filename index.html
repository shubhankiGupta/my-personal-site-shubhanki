  <p>Presently, I am working as an Assistant Manager in Bosch India Limited, in Industry
    4.0 and IoT innovation department. I worked and gained excellence in
    PLC(programmable Logic Controller) programming of various make like Siemens,
    Fanuc, Bosch, and Allen Bradley, which has helped me accustomed with input and
    output signals of peripheral devices like sensors and actuators. I have designed an
    architecture for machine signals' data acquisitions to the server through an IoT
    gateway.My Passion, knowledge, and leading initiatives were the key driving factors for
    becoming one of the founding team members of Industry 4.0. I have been leading the
    team here to work on the Industrial Internet of Things(IIoT). We are working on
    Sense, Connect, Consume, and Cognition layers of digital transformation initiatives.
    We have accomplished one of the biggest challenges of machine network connectivity
    by developing customized IoT gateways for industrial old and obsolete controllers. I
    also designed interactive dashboards, business intelligence reports with early warning
    alerts on mobile apps and emails for deviation management and smart predictive
    maintenance use cases. This initiative has taken the organization a leap forward
    toward the vision of "Future Factory" in the era of digital transformation.</p>
